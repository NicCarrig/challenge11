# Challenge 11 - Note Taker
Express.js Note Taker

This application allows the user to make a to-do style list in their web browser. The user is able to enter the title and text of their note and then save it, as well as viewing and deleting previous notes. 

When the user initially navigates to the site, they should see the welcome/banner screen. Once the user clicks the "Get Started" button they will then be sent to the notes pages where they can start to enter, view, and delete notes. Each note will be given a unique ID and can be either displayed or deleted using it.

## Dependencies
This app uses node.js and express.js
